# C7$-Finance

## INTRODUCTION
This project is part of an audited online course I used to teach myself Web Development. The course is: [Building Dynamic Websites](http://cs75.tv/2012/summer/) by Harvard University

## PROBLEM
The goal of this project is to implement C75Finance, a website that allows users to manage portfolios of stocks. 

The detailed specifications are specified [HERE](http://cdn.cs75.net/2012/summer/projects/1/project1.pdf)

## SPECIFICATIONS

* Your site must require that a user logs in with a username and password in order to see or do anything (except, obviously, login or register)
* The Website allows users to register for an account with a valid email address and a password that is at least    six characters and include both alphabetic and numeric.
* Upon	registering, a user should receive a free gift: $10,000 in cash.
* The site allows the user to look up a quote
* The site allows the user to sell stocks they already own.
* User is able to check how much money is in their portfolio.
* Rigorous client and server-side, Under no circumstances should the reviewer be able to crash the site or induce unreasonable behaviour. Letting us sell more shares than we own is not, shall we say, reasonable. We will bang on your code and try to find faults; do not let us succeed.
